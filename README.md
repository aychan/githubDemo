<b>Installing Git:</b>

WINDOWS: Git Bash - cool dedicated terminal to use Git: https://git-for-windows.github.io/

MAC/OS X: You already have Bash. Find your 'Launchpad' and open up Terminal. Bash comes with the kernel so you're halfway there to using Git. Homebrew is typically used to download packages on OS X so in the Terminal try typing in <code>brew install git</code>.

LINUX: Open up a terminal and try <code>sudo apt-get install git</code>. This should start the process to get git onto your system (This also assumes internet connection so make sure you have that on your computer).

*Also, if using the terminal is really not your thing, Git does have a downloadable GUI applications for all operating systems for more visual representations of repositories, branches - you name it: https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/
